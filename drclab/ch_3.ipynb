    "The field of genomics has seen massive growth in the past few years because of advancements in sequencing technologies that have pushed genomic data in the wave of big data. ML techniques, with their ability to analyze large-scale data, can turn this complex genomic data into biological insights that can in turn convert into useful products. ML algorithms have been widely used in biology and genomics to apply to complex multi-dimensional datasets for the building of predictive models to solve complex biological problems such as disorder risk prediction, mental illness prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and so on. This chapter introduces the main ML algorithms and libraries that are commonly used in genomic data analysis. By the end of the chapter, you will know what supervised and unsupervised ML methods are, understand the most common ML algorithms and libraries for genomics, and know when and how to use them. You will know how to build a predictive model using genomics data and be aware of the challenges encountered by ML algorithms for genomics and potential solutions for addressing the same."

    "For example, a lot of effort has been put into the generation of deep datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, 2014), the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE, 2012), GenBank from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, 1988), and so on."

    "### Thanks to rapid advancements in NGS, genomics has shown tremendous growth in the last decade, which has led to an outpouring of massive sequence data. In addition to whole-genome sequencing (WGS), other promising techniques have emerged, such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) to measure the expressed region of the genome, whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) or RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to measure mRNA expression, ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify transcription-factor binding sites, and Ribo-sequencing (Ribo-seq) to identify actively translating mRNAs for quantifying relative protein abundance, and so on. The challenge now is not “what to measure ” but “how to analyze the data to extract meaningful data and turn those insights into applications”. While the development of NGS technologies and the generation of massive data has provided opportunities for a new field called “bioinformatics” to grow significantly, it has also opened the door for the application of ML techniques with the goal of mining these large-scale biological genomic datasets."
