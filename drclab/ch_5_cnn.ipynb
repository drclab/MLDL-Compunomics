    "#### Say our input is a 32-pixel by 32-pixel grayscale image where every pixel in the grayscale image is represented by a value between 0 to 255. Here, 0 indicates black, 255 represents indicates white, and any values between 0 and 255 indicate various shades of gray. Since the grayscale image has only one channel, the image can be represented as 32 x 32 x 1 = 1024, and consequently has 1,024 nodes in the input layer of the FNN. Suppose our next layer (hidden layer) has 100 nodes, and since this should be fully connected to the previous layer, we will have 1,024 x 100 = 102,400 weights for the first 2 layers (input and the first hidden layer). Since we know by now that a complex problem such as this requires multiple hidden layers in the FNN to map the inputs and the outputs in the training data to generate an accurate model, as such, we now have a problem with too many parameters in the FNN, which makes the training process very complex because of the increased dimension space. In addition, it makes the learning process slower, uses more resources, and increases the chances of overfitting."
