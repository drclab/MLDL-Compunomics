    "The field of genomics, which consists of the most natural language ever – a sequence of nucleotides (A, G, C, and T) – is very well suited for RNNs applications, such as for predicting proteins from DNA sequences, predicting the binding domains of proteins, predicting the interaction between enhancers and promoters, predicting structural motifs, predicting base calls from sequencing instruments, optimizing coding sequences for increased protein production, predicting function, and so on. In this chapter, you will learn what RNNs are, how they are different from FNNs and CNNs, and how they are better suited for sequential data. By the end of this chapter, you will understand what RNNs are and why they are important in DL, the different types of RNN architectures and when to use what, and the different RNN applications in genomics."

    "Another good way of illustrating how RNNs work is to explain it with an example: Imagine you have a standard FNN and give it a DNA sequence (ATGCGAG) and it processes one nucleotide at a time but by the time it reaches the last nucleotide (in this example ‘G’) it has forgotten everything about other nucleotides ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘G’, ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘A’ and FNN can't predict what nucleotide would come next. This information is important for sequential data such as DNA sequences because there is a structure to the sequence"

    "##### Understanding RNNs through Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) predictions Transcription factors (TF) play a key role in gene regulation, particularly during transcription, where they bind to the promoter regions and initiate the process of transcription. Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) in DNA are short sequences in gene regulatory regions (such as promoters) and typically range in size from 5 bp to 20 bp. Each TF binds to a different TFBS and controls gene regulation in the cell. Thus, identifying the TF binding sites is key for us to understand cellular and molecular processes. Several experimental methods can identify TFBSs, such as ChIP-Seq technologies and databases such as ENCODE, which have made TFBS information available to researchers. However, ChIP-Seq technologies are expensive, slow, and laborious, and cannot find patterns in the identified TFBS. Several computational methods have become the go-to for solving this very important problem of identifying TFBSs. Given a particular sequence, predicting whether it is a TFBS or not is the core task of bioinformatics. In the following toy example, let’s see how we can use RNNs to predict a TFBS from DNA sequences. The problem of TFBS can be thought of as a binary classification problem – that is, whether the TFBS can be found in a DNA sequence or not, which we represent as 1 or 0, respectively. The input to the RNN model is the input DNA sequences and their targets, which have labels of 1 or 0. The goal here is to build a highly accurate classification model using an RNN that can be used to"

    "##### RNNs are a special type of neural network that is well suited for sequential data such as time series, audio, video, and text. Research showed that RNNs have improved the performance of sequential data types when compared to other architectures such as FNNs and CNNs. The key to an RNN is the sequence memory state, which helps it store information from the previously analyzed state; this is good for sequential signal analysis and predictive analysis. In this chapter, we learned how RNNs are different from FNNs and CNNs. We understood the different types of RNNs and what makes them good for sequential data analysis by looking at a few examples. RNNs, as you may have noticed, are good for mapping a fixed or variable-sized input sequence to a fixed or variable-sized output; we have seen several examples to understand this.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### We also looked at how RNNs can help with genomics tasks and understood the different architectural types of RNNs. Bidirectional RNN, LSTM, and GRU are variants of RNNs that are capable of long-term associations, thereby retaining the information from an infinite sequence, which is very common in genomics. They address long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You were also introduced to the different RNN types and their applications in various domains, such as image captioning, language translation, and others. Finally, we looked at how RNNs are used to solve some of the key problems in genomics, such as TF binding site detection, miRNA-mRNA sequence modeling, gene expression analysis, histone modifications, base calling, and more. In the next chapter, we will look at another exciting neural network architecture called autoencoders, which has a lot of potential applications in genomics."
