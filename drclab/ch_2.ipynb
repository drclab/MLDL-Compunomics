    "#### Sanger sequencing, also known as the “chain termination method” is the first-generation sequencing method, and was developed by Frederick Sanger and his colleagues in 1977 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC431765/). It was used by the Human Genome Project to sequence the first draft of the human genome. This method relies on the natural method of DNA replication. Sanger sequencing involves the random incorporation of bases called deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) by DNA polymerase into strands during copying, resulting in the termination of invitro transcription. These bases in the short fragments are then read out based on the presence of a dye molecule attached to the special bases at the end of each fragment. Despite being replaced by NGS technologies, Sanger sequencing remains the gold standard sequencing method and is routinely being used by research labs throughout the world for quick verification of short sequences generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other methods."

The typical size fragments generated by Illumina are in the range of 50-300 bases. Illumina dominates the NGS market."
