    "#### Over the past few years, data-driven deep learning (DL) approaches have made impressive progress in the genomics field. The development of high-throughput technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) has played a major part in this data-driven revolution. Several neural network (NN) architectures have found success in the genomics domain. For instance, in the previous chapters, we have seen feed-forward neural networks (FNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been successfully used for many genomics applications. So far, all these NN architectures require that you have well-labeled data. However, a lack of ground truth and accurate labels is common in the genomics domain, which limits the application of supervised learning (SL) methods. NGS has significantly increased the use of gene expression assays, and there is so much genomics data out there with no label. Several methods exist to generate signals from these unlabeled datasets such as clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and so on, but integrative analysis involving multi-omics datasets is challenging with these conventional methods. Furthermore, in non-model species, the genome-wide gene expression analysis is very challenging because of the unavailability of gene function information and lack of knowledge of the organismâ€™s biology. What we need are unbiased approaches that can find patterns in these large and complex unlabeled datasets in an unsupervised way."

    "##### Autoencoders are a type of NN architecture that can harness the power of DL in an unsupervised way. They are the most important NN architecture for unsupervised learning (UL). Unlike vanilla NN architectures, which model data by minimizing the loss between the predictions and original data, autoencoders try to learn an identity function that minimizes the loss function. Autoencoders have found a lot of success in several applications such as image compression, image denoising, image generation, recommendation system, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) prediction, and so on. In this chapter, you will understand what unsupervised DL is, why it is important, the different types of unsupervised DL methods, what autoencoders are, and, finally, the different applications of autoencoders in genomics. By the end of this chapter, you will know what unsupervised DL is, how autoencoders work, and the genomics applications of autoencoders."
